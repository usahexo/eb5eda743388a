#  History of Bingo in Kenya

The origins of Bingo in Kenya are a mystery, but it is clear that the game has been played there for many years. The first written reference to Bingo in Kenya comes from a newspaper article published in 1924. At that time, the game was already quite popular and was being played by both adults and children.

In the early days, Bingo was simply known as "Number Draw". Players would purchase tickets which contained a list of numbers. One number would be drawn at a time, and players would mark off the number on their tickets as it was called out. The first player to mark off all of their numbers won the game.

Over the years, the rules of Bingo have changed somewhat, but the basic premise remains the same. Today, most Kenyans play Bingo using cards rather than tickets. The cards contain 25 squares, each of which has a different number printed on it. One player is chosen to call out numbers, and players mark off the numbers on their cards as they are called. The first player to fill up all four corners of their card (or any other combination agreed upon before the start of the game) wins the jackpot.

Bingo is immensely popular in Kenya and there are numerous clubs and venues where people can play the game. In addition to its popularity among adults, Bingo is also enjoyed by children who often play it in school competitions. There are even pro-Bingo leagues in Kenya where players compete for large cash prizes.

Bingo is a fun, social game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's no wonder that it's so popular in Kenya!
