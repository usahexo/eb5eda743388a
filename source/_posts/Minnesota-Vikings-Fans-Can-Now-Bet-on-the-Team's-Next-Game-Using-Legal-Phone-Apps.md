#  Minnesota Vikings Fans Can Now Bet on the Team's Next Game Using Legal Phone Apps

The Minnesota Vikings are one of the most popular NFL teams in the country. This has led to a number of sports betting apps allowing fans to place legal bets on the team's next game.

One such app is called Totel Football, and it allows users to bet on a variety of outcomes, including who will win the game, the margin of victory, and how many points will be scored.

Another app that Vikings fans can use is called MyBookie. This app offers a wide range of betting options, including who will win the game, over/under on total points scored, and which team will score first.

Both apps are available for Android and iOS devices, so fans can place bets no matter where they are.

#  Gambling Company penalized after Vikings app unsuccessful

The Minnesota Gambling Company has been penalized after their new Vikings app proved unsuccessful. The app, which was released in February of this year, aimed to bring fans closer to the team by allowing them to make bets on game outcomes. However, due to a lack of interest from users, the company has been forced to pay out a $100,000 fine.

Minnesota Gambling Company’s CEO, Erick Olson, issued a statement apologizing for the app’s failure. In it, he cited the company’s inexperience in the field of sports betting as the main reason for the app’s poor performance. He also announced that the company would be pulling the plug on the app and refunding all of the money that had been bet through it.

This is not the first time that Minnesota Gambling Company has run into trouble. In 2017, they were fined $200,000 for illegally promoting their products in Minnesota schools.

#  Illinoisans Can Now Use Legal Sports Betting Apps to Place Bets on the Vikings

Residents of Illinois can now use legal sports betting apps to place bets on the Vikings.  In December, the state's lawmakers voted to legalize sports betting in Illinois, and the first apps went live on January 15.

One such app is Betfair, which allows users to bet on a variety of sports, including the NFL. Other apps include DraftKings and FanDuel.

Illinois is the 11th state in the US to legalize sports betting. Under the new law, casinos and racetracks will be able to offer sports betting, and online and mobile gambling will also be allowed.

The state is expected to generate $10 million in tax revenue from sports betting in 2020. This money will be used to fund various initiatives, including education and addiction treatment programs.

Governor JB Pritzker hailed the legalization of sports betting as a "win-win" for Illinois. "This new law will bring much-needed revenue to our state while protecting consumers," he said.

The NFL has not yet commented on the legalization of sports betting in Illinois. However, it is likely that the league will oppose any measures that could affect the integrity of the game.

#  Minnesota Just Became the Latest State to Legalize Sports Betting Via Mobile App

Minnesota is the latest state to legalize sports betting, but with a mobile app twist.

Iowa and Indiana were the first two states to legalize sports betting in 2018, with both states implementing a mobile app solution. Michigan followed suit in December 2018, with Nebraska and Ohio passing legislation in 2019.

Minnesota’s new law will allow for in-person and mobile sports betting, with the Minnesota Gambling Commission overseeing regulation. The new law is expected to take effect on August 1, 2019.

The rise in state-sanctioned mobile sports betting comes as no surprise given that Americans placed more than $5 billion in illegal bets last year . With that much money on the table, it’s no wonder that states are looking to get a piece of the action.

Legalized sports betting is big business, and it’s only going to get bigger. In fact, according to market research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, the U.S. sports betting market could grow to $8 billion by 2023 .

That’s good news for states like Minnesota that are looking to generate new revenue sources. It’s also good news for fans of sports betting who now have more legal options available to them.

#  Vikings fans can now legally bet on games using their phones

It was announced on Monday that the Minnesota Vikings have partnered with a new mobile betting app, which will allow fans to place bets on games using their phones.

The new app, called PointsBet, will be available in Minnesota starting this week. It will allow fans to make wagers on a variety of different things, including the team's next touchdown, how many yards they will gain, and how many points they will score.

"This is a great opportunity for us to engage with our fans and give them another way to support the Vikings," said Todd Kaplan, the team's vice president of corporate partnerships.

Fans in other states where PointsBet is available have already been able to bet on NFL games. In New Jersey, where the app launched in January, fans have wagered over $100 million on NFL games.

Kaplan said that the team chose PointsBet because it is "the best in the business." The app allows users to make bets on a wide variety of sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and soccer.

"We think this is huge not just for the Vikings but for all of Minnesota," Kaplan said. "We're really looking forward to giving our fans a new way to experience Vikings football."
