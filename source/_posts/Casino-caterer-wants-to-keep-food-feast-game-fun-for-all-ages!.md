#  Can you stomach a casino food feast game? 

The Valley View Casino Resort in San Diego is home to an annual foodie feast game that will test your stomach's limits. The "Gorging Games" consist of a series of eating challenges that pit contestants against one another to see who can consume the most food in the shortest amount of time.

Competitors are given a limited time frame to eat as much as possible from a buffet table full of various types of food, including pizza, tacos, burgers, chicken wings and fries. The games are split into different categories based on the type of food being consumed, and there is even a dessert category that includes items like cake, brownies and ice cream.

The record for the most amount of food consumed in the Gorging Games is held by professional competitive eater Joey Chestnut, who ate 5.5 pounds of lobster in 10 minutes during the 2016 tournament. Other notable competitors include Takeru Kobayashi, who once ate 9.75 pounds of shrimp in six minutes, and Sonya Thomas, who downed 11.75 pounds of ribs in 12 minutes.

#  How young is too young for a casino food feast game?

If you have ever been to a casino, you know that the food isn’t exactly the healthiest. In fact, it is often quite greasy and unhealthy. This can be a bit of a problem for those who are trying to watch their weight or eat healthy. But what about kids? Is there an age at which it is too young for children to eat casino food?

There really isn’t a definitive answer when it comes to determining an appropriate age for kids to start indulging in casino food. It all depends on the child’s individual palate and digestive system. Some kids may be able to handle greasy, unhealthy foods at a young age, while others may not be able to tolerate them until they are older. It is important to keep in mind that everyone is different, so there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

That said, it is generally recommended that kids avoid eating too much casino food until they are at least 10 years old. This is because their bodies are still developing and may not be able to handle the unhealthy ingredients found in casino food. However, if your child seems to be fine after eating casino food, there is no reason why they can’t continue doing so as long as they are enjoying it and it doesn’t have any negative impacts on their health.

So, how young is too young for a casino food feast game? There isn’t necessarily a definitive answer, but most experts recommend waiting until your child is at least 10 years old before letting them indulge in casino cuisine

#  Casino catering must meet legal age requirements for food feast game

Casino catering is a popular option for gaming enthusiasts who want to enjoy their favorite pastime with friends or co-workers. However, in order to provide this type of event, the catering company must be aware of and adhere to the legal age requirements for food service.

In most cases, this means that no one under the age of eighteen will be allowed to handle or consume any food items. The only exception to this rule is if the catering company obtains a special permit that allows underage participants to be served specific items.

Even if a permit is obtained, there are still restrictions on what types of food can be served. For example, casinos are not allowed to serve alcohol and minors are not allowed to consume caffeine. In addition, all food must meet strict safety guidelines in order to prevent from any potential health hazards.

The staff of the casino catering company must also be aware of these requirements and ensure that they are properly followed. Failing to do so can result in citations or even loss of the permit. By understanding and complying with the legal age requirements for food service, casino catering can provide a fun and safe event for everyone involved.
