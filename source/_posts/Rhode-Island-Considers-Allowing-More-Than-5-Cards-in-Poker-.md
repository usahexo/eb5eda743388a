#  Rhode Island Considers Allowing More Than 5 Cards in Poker 

The decision to allow more than five cards in poker might seem like a small change, but for the state of Rhode Island, it could mean big money.

Rhode Island lawmakers are currently debating a bill that would allow more than five cards in poker, a move that could potentially bring in millions of dollars in additional revenue each year.

If the bill is approved, Rhode Island would become the second state in the country to allow more than five cards in poker. The first state to do so was Nevada, which made the change back in 2015.

So why are lawmakers considering this change?

There are a few reasons. For one, allowing more than five cards could make poker games more exciting and attractive to players. And secondly, it could also help to attract new players to the game, which could lead to an influx of revenue for the state.

In fact, a recent study found that if Rhode Island were to allow six cards in poker, it could bring in an additional $2 million per year in revenue. That’s a significant amount of money and could certainly help to offset some of the state’s budget deficits.

At this point, it’s still unclear whether or not the bill will pass. But if it does, it will be interesting to see how much of an impact it has on Rhode Island’s economy.

#  Rhode Island to Allow up to 10 Cards in Poker 

The Rhode Island Senate has recently passed a bill that will allow up to 10 players to play together in a poker game. The bill was proposed by Representative Jared Nunes and is designed to increase the excitement of the game while also benefiting the local economy.

Under the new law, players will be allowed to use any combination of playing cards, including jokers, to make the game more exciting. There will also be no limit on the amount of money that can change hands during the course of a game. This means that players can bet as much money as they want and there is potential for some very large pots.

The casino industry in Rhode Island is hoping that this new law will help revive interest in poker, which has been declining in recent years. Poker is still popular, but it is no longer as popular as it once was. This new law could help to change that.

There are some concerns that the new law could lead to problems with gambling addiction, but Representative Nunes believes that this is not a major concern. He believes that gambling addiction is already a problem in Rhode Island and that this new law will do nothing to make it worse.

The Rhode Island House of Representatives still needs to approve the bill before it becomes law, but this is seen as a formality.

#  Rhode Island May Lift the Card Limit in Poker 

The Rhode Island General Assembly is considering a bill to increase the betting limit for poker from $2 to $10. The bill, introduced by Rep. Blake Filippi, would also prohibit casinos from offering Texas hold 'em and Omaha tournaments with bets of more than $10.

Rep. Filippi said the proposed legislation is designed to protect the state's casinos from being cannibalized by online poker sites. "If we don't do something soon, our casinos are going to be overrun by people playing on their phones and laptops," he said.

Casino executives support the higher betting limit, arguing that it would make their games more competitive with online poker sites. "It's important that we have parity with other states and the internet poker industry," said Scott Haywood, president of the Rhode Island Hospitality Association.

The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Corporations.

#  Rhode Island looking at allowing more than 5 cards in poker 

PROVIDENCE, RI - A proposal that would change the way Rhode Island regulates poker is up for debate this week in the House of Representatives. 

The measure, introduced by Rep. Carlos Tobon, would allow players to have more than five cards in their hand during a game. The current law restricts players to just five cards. 

"This is a game of skill," Tobon said in a statement. "We need to make sure that our regulations reflect that and do not unnecessarily restrict gameplay." 

The proposed bill has generated some controversy, with some lawmakers arguing that it could lead to more gambling addictions. But Tobon says the measure would actually help reduce addiction by making the game more fun and exciting. 

"I don't see this as a big issue," he said. "If people are going to gamble, they're going to gamble regardless of whether or not we have these regulations in place." 

The Rhode Island House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bill later this week.

#  Rhode Island Could Allow 10 Cards In Poker

Rhode Island are discussing a bill that would change the number of cards players are allowed from five to ten.

The amendment, put forward by Representative Scott Slater, would also see the betting limit doubled from $2 to $4.

The current proposal, if passed, will allow for two rounds of betting instead of the one currently in place.

This change could mean big things for Rhode Island, who hope to attract more tourists and players to the state with the new legislation. The hope is that with more cards and bigger bets available, players will be attracted to the state and its casinos.
