#  What are the 5 Guidelines for Travelling Abroad?

Travelling is one of the most amazing experiences a person can have in their lifetime. It allows you to explore new places, meet new people, and learn about different cultures. However, before you take off on your next adventure, it’s important to be aware of the guidelines for travelling abroad.

1. Do your research

Before you go anywhere, it’s important to do your research and figure out what you need to pack, what documents you need to bring with you, and what vaccines you may require. This will help make your trip run smoother and ensure that you don’t forget anything important.

2. Pack light

When travelling abroad, it’s important to pack light. Not only will this save you from having to carry heavy bags around, but it will also allow you to move more easily and explore your destination without having to worry about your belongings.

3. Respect the culture

When travelling to a foreign country, it’s important to respect the culture of that country. This means learning about the customs and traditions of the people there and following them as closely as possible. It also means being aware of the laws of that country and not breaking them.

4. Be aware of your surroundings

When travelling abroad, it’s important to be aware of your surroundings and stay alert at all times. This means avoiding shady areas, keeping your valuables hidden away, and being aware of who or what is around you.

5. Have fun!

#  Why are they important?

Markdown is important because it is a simple and easy to use markup language that can be used to create documents for the web. It can be used to create HTML documents, as well as documents that can be published on different platforms such as Github and WordPress.

Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004, and it has become one of the most popular ways to create content for the web. It is a simple text-based markup language that uses plain text symbols to format documents. This makes it easy for anyone to learn and use, even if they have no experience with coding or programming.

# How does it work?

Markdown works by using simple symbols to indicate how a document should be formatted. For example, you can use asterisks *asterisks* to create a heading, and underscores _underscores_ to create a paragraph. When you save the document as HTML, the symbols are converted into the appropriate code so that the document will display correctly on the web.

This makes markdown a very versatile tool, since you can use it to create both simple and complex documents without having to learn any coding languages. And since markdown is based on plain text, it can be used on any device or platform without any special software or applications.

# What are its benefits?

The biggest benefit of markdown is its simplicity. It is easy for anyone to learn and use, regardless of their experience with coding or programming. And since markdown is based on plain text, it can be used on any device or platform without any special software or applications.

Another advantage of markdown is that it creates valid HTML code. This means that your documents will look good on any device or platform, regardless of what browser or operating system is being used. Markdown also has built-in support for tables and math formulas, making it a versatile tool for creating complex documents.

#  How can they be useful?

Markdown is a popular lightweight markup language which can be easily converted into HTML. It is used to format documents for the web and it can be very useful for creating things like:

- Blog posts
- eBooks
- Reports
- Documentation
- Landing pages

There are many different ways that markdown can be used, but some of the most common ones include:

#1 BLOGGING
A lot of people use markdown for blogging because it is quick, easy and makes your blog post look nice and clean. You don’t need to worry about formatting your text or adding any annoying HTML tags. Just write your post in markdown and it will automatically be converted to HTML when you publish it.

#2 EBOOKS
If you want to create an eBook, markdown can be a great way to do it. It is easy to use and you can create a nice looking eBook without any complicated formatting. All you need to do is type your text in markdown, and then use a tool like Leanpub or Amazon KindleGen to convert it into a eBook format.


    #3 REPORTS AND DOCUMENTATION  Markdown can also be used for reports and documentation. If you want to create a simple report or document, markdown is a good option because it’s easy to use and doesn’t require any complex formatting. Just write your text in markdown and it will automatically be styled correctly when you export it as HTML or PDF.

#  When should they be followed?

There are moments in life when it's necessary to follow rules - whether they're written or unwritten. When it comes to the law, there are times when following its stipulations is a must, while other instances may allow for a bit of leeway. The same holds true for etiquette; there are certain customs that should be followed out of respect, while others can be bent or broken depending on the situation.

When it comes to etiquette, there are a few general rules that should always be followed: common courtesies like saying please and thank you, not talking with your mouth full, and being aware of your surroundings. These rules are pretty straightforward and easy to remember. Other etiquette guidelines can be a little more nuanced. For example, when is it appropriate to send a Thank You card? Or should you write in pen or pencil? Is it ever acceptable to wear white after Labor Day?

There's no one answer to these questions - it all depends on personal preference and regional customs. However, there are some general guidelines that can help make the decision-making process a little easier. In most cases, if you're not sure whether or not you should do something, it's best to play it safe and go with the traditional option.

Following etiquette rules isn't always easy, but it's definitely worth it in the end. Not only will you make a good impression on others, but you'll also feel better about yourself knowing that you're acting with decorum and respect. So the next time you're faced with a complicated etiquette dilemma, take a deep breath and relax - chances are, there's a right answer out there somewhere!

#  What happens if they're not followed?

If you're not following the correct safety procedures when working with certain tools or chemicals, there's a good chance you could end up injured. In some cases, not following the safety procedures can even lead to death. Here are just a few of the potential consequences of not following safety procedures:

1. Burns: Burns are one of the most common types of injuries, and can occur from contact with many different types of materials. Burns can be very painful and can often require surgery and long-term treatment.

2. Cuts: Cuts are also a common injury, and can often occur when working with knives or other sharp objects. Cuts can vary in severity from minor cuts that only require a bandage to deep lacerations that may require stitches.

3. Eye Injuries: Eye injuries can be very serious and can often lead to blindness if not treated properly. Some common eye injuries include chemical burns, corneal abrasions, and retinal detachment.

4. Respiratory Injuries: Respiratory injuries can occur when working with harmful fumes or particles. These injuries can range from mild irritation to life-threatening respiratory failure.

5. Skin Infections: Skin infections can occur when working with dirty or contaminated materials. These infections can often be very difficult to treat and may require medication or surgery.
